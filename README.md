# AI-ML Based Cyber Resilience for Emergent Healthcare Systems

## Overview
This repository presents a hybrid AI-based cyber resilience framework
designed for emergent healthcare environments. The system integrates
K-Means clustering, Isolation Forest anomaly detection, and
Reinforcement Learning to adaptively detect and respond to cyber threats.

## Research Motivation
Healthcare systems are increasingly targeted by ransomware and
advanced cyberattacks. Static security mechanisms fail to adapt to
dynamic threat patterns, motivating the need for real-time,
learning-driven cyber resilience.

## Methodology
- K-Means Clustering for behavioral grouping
- Isolation Forest for anomaly detection
- Reinforcement Learning agent for dynamic threshold optimization

## Datasets
- Diabetes Dataset (Kaggle)
- Drugs Product Dataset (Kaggle)
- Healthcare Dataset (Kaggle)

## Results
The RL-optimized Isolation Forest dynamically adjusted contamination
thresholds across datasets, improving anomaly detection accuracy
while reducing false positives.

## Code Structure
- main.py: Pipeline execution
- preprocessing.py: Data cleaning & scaling
- rl_agent.py: Reinforcement learning optimization
- isolation_forest.py: Anomaly detection

## Paper
The full research paper is available via NEIU Digital Commons and is
submitted as a preprint to arXiv.
