# AI-ML Based Cyber Resilience for Emergent Healthcare Systems

## Overview
This project simulates the use of machine learning techniques, including Isolation Forest and synthetic anomaly injection, to detect cyber threats in emergent healthcare environments. It serves as a demonstration for anomaly detection and resilience evaluation using AI methods.

## Features
- Real-time simulation of cyber anomalies (DDoS, unauthorized access, etc.)
- Synthetic healthcare-like data generation
- Anomaly detection with Isolation Forest
- Evaluation with confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve

## Getting Started
1. Install required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

2. Run the Python script:
```bash
python resilience_model.py
```

## Ethical Considerations
> This project uses only **synthetic data**. No real patient or identifiable information is used.
> Ensure compliance with HIPAA/GDPR and institutional policies when handling real data.
